# The-Cold-The-Warm-and-the-Neutral
**A machine learning project to classify foods into Cold, Hot, and Moderate temperaments based on nutritional data, inspired by traditional medicine.**

**Introduction**

In traditional medicine, foods are classified into Cold, Hot, or Moderate temperaments based on their physiological effects, a practice rooted in cultural wisdom. Our project, "The Cold, The Warm, and The Neutral," seeks to bridge this traditional knowledge with modern nutritional science by using machine learning to predict food temperaments from nutritional data sourced from the USDAâ€™s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). Our goal is to investigate whether nutritional profiles correlate with traditional temperament classifications, potentially validating or refining these ancient categorizations. We collected 100 food samples, applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on 85 and 100 samples to reduce dimensionality, and used K-Means clustering to explore natural groupings. Machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM) were trained, with Gradient Boosting achieving 81.58% accuracy and a 0.80 Moderate F1-Score after human-in-the-loop validation. PCA highlighted key nutrients like protein, lipids, and vitamins, while K-Means suggested four clusters with partial temperament alignment. The results indicate a promising relationship between nutritional data and traditional classifications, with opportunities for further data collection and analysis to deepen insights.
